          <p class="info-text">The Navy SEALs were originally formed during WWII when the US Navy realized a demand for special reconnasisance of landing beaches and coastal defenses. Originally known as the Scouts and Raiders, these highly trained forces conducted specialized missions aimed at maintaining beach positions or guiding beach assaults.</p>
          <p class="info-text">Modern day SEALs undergo rigorous training that tests their brute strength along with their mental fortitude. The approximate time for a Navy SEAL to receive adequate training is one year. This training proves invaluable as SEALs carry out some of the most advanced missions to date.</p>
